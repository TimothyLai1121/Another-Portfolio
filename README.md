# What is included in my website
* I included one `@keyframe` to make my `navbar` bounc whenever user hovering.
* I included one `skewed` method that underline my `navbar`.
* I included `:root` and `variable` methods in my `style.css`.
* I tested out a `jQuery` method to help out my GitHub Button on `line 238th` if you can give me feedback.
