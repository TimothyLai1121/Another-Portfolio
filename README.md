Responsive: Desktop & Mobile [^footnote]

    [^footnote]: What is the right way to make sure that my css doesn't have to include @media?
    [^footnote]: I just realized that since I do have 3 different monitors, depend on my workflow, I usually confused and make my progress slower.
    [^footnote]: I realized that my page start to break when it come to 4K resolution. 

# What is included in my website :mag_right:
* I included one `@keyframe` to make my `navbar` bounc whenever user hovering.
* I included one `skewed` method that underline my `navbar`.
* I included `:root` and `variable` methods in my `style.css`.
* I tested out a `jQuery` method to help out my GitHub Button on `line 238th` if you can give me feedback.
* Of course, since I know you guys have to grade these challenges, I want you guys to have a chuckle looking at my page

# Implemented from Georgia Tech GitLab :hot_face:

# Final Thoughts :thinking:

 > Emoji is still fun right?

 > Classes are definitely moving fast even it is a part-time. Can I ask but what is Tailwind & BootStrap? Do you guys encourage to use that to focus more on technical skills like API and Javascript that we are currently learning?
