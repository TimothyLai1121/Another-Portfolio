# What is included in my website
* I included one `@keyframe` to make my `navbar` bounc whenever user hovering.
* I included one `skewed` method that underline my `navbar`.
* I included `:root` and `variable` methods in my `style.css`.
* I tested out a `jQuery` method to help out my GitHub Button on `line 238th` if you can give me feedback.
* Of course, since I know you guys have to grade these challenges, I want you guys to have a chuckle looking at my page

# Implemented from Georgia Tech GitLab :hot_face:
 > I was wondering why did we have to download Screentify in the beginning. Now I understand.
